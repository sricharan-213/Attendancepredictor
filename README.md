🧠 Program Logic Overview

Take current attendance data from the user

Let the user choose whether to:

Attend more classes, or

Attended classes

Attendance percentage

Suggest a plan to maintain or reach 75% attendance

▶️ Sample Output
=========================================
           ATTENDANCE PREDICTOR
=========================================
Total Classes Held After Plan : 120
Classes Attended               : 90
Classes Missed                 : 30
Predicted Attendance %         : 75.00%

75% ATTENDANCE PLANNER:
You can safely bunk up to : 0 classes to maintain >= 75%
Great! Your attendance is already above 75%.
